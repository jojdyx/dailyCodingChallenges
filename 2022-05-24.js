// Find the first non-consecutive number
// Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.
// By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.
// E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.
// If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.
// The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!
function firstNonConsecutive (arr) {  
    for (let i = 1 ; i<arr.length; i++){
      if (arr[i] !== arr[i-1] + 1){
        return arr[i]
      }
    }
    return null

// List Filtering
// In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.
// Example
// filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
// filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
// filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]
function filter_list(l) {
    return l.filter((x)=> typeof(x) == 'number')
