// Find the next perfect square!
// You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
// Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.
// If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.
// Examples:(Input --> Output)
// 121 --> 144
// 625 --> 676
// 114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square
function findNextSquare(sq) {
    return sq % Math.sqrt(sq) == 0 ? Math.pow(Math.sqrt(sq)+1, 2) : -1
}

// Binary Addition
// Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.
// The binary number returned should be a string.
// Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))
// 1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
// 5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)
function addBinary(a,b) {
    return (a+b).toString(2)

// Categorize New Member
// The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.
// To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.
// Input
// Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.
// Output
// Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
// Example
// input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
// output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]
