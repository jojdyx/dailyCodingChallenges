// If you've completed this kata already and want a bigger challenge, here's the 3D version
// Bob is bored during his physics lessons so he's built himself a toy box to help pass the time. The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity.
// There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column contains a_i cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, d, which can be either 'L' or 'R' (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.

// +---+                                       +---+
// +---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+

// Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the n columns after Bob switches the gravity.
// Examples (input -> output:
// * 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      ->  [1, 2, 2, 3]
// * 'L', [1, 4, 5, 3, 5 ]  ->  [5, 5, 4, 3, 1]

// Pillars
// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).
